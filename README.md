# 🚀 Hey there, I’m Emmanuel (a.k.a. Manny) 👋  

I’m a **Software Engineer** with 5+ years of experience, including 3 years deep in the trenches of **Machine Learning, NLP, and GPU programming**. I love building things that are not only powerful but also **efficient, scalable, and fun to use**.  

> ⚡ From distributed systems to high-performance ML pipelines, I thrive where code meets complexity.

## 🧠 What I Do Best  

- **Software Engineering**  
  Crafting scalable systems, building microservices, and architecting distributed platforms that don’t crumble under pressure.  

- **Machine Learning + GPU Programming**  
  Optimizing and training ML models with a focus on **speed and efficiency**. Whether it’s a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** or a **language model**, I know how to make GPUs sweat (in a good way).  

- **Algorithms, Data Structures & Databases**  
  Clean, optimized, and performant solutions powered by strong CS fundamentals and SQL/database management skills.

## 🤖 NLP & Transformers Magic  

I work a lot with **Hugging Face Transformers**, building **LLMs** for:  
- 📝 Text Summarization  
- ❓ Question Answering  
- 🗣️ Human-computer interaction  

If it involves **language + intelligence**, chances are I’ve tinkered with it.

## 🔥 Always Leveling Up  

Tech never sits still, and neither do I.  
I’m constantly exploring:  
- 🖼️ Multi-modal models  
- ☁️ Distributed services  
- 🧑‍💻 Open-source contributions  

Because growth = fun.

## 🌍 A Little Philosophy  

I believe in creating solutions that sit at the sweet spot of **performance, intelligence, and real-world impact**.  

If you’re into high-performance systems, AI breakthroughs, or just cool software engineering—stick around. You might like what you see.
